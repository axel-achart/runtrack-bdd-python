# 📂 Runtrack BDD – SQL & Python  

## 📌 Introduction  
This repository contains exercises completed over 2 days to learn SQL with MySQL and use it with Python. The goal is to manipulate databases, write SQL queries, and interact with MySQL via Python.  

---

## 📅 Day 1: SQL  

1. **Install MySQL**: Install MySQL server and set up the SQL terminal.  
2. **Create the Database**: Create the database `LaPlateforme`.  
3. **Student Table**: Add a `student` table with basic fields (id, first name, last name, age, email).  
4. **Show Columns**: Check the structure of the `student` table.  
5. **Insert Data**: Add students to the `student` table.  
6. **Retrieve Students**: Select and display all students.  
7. **Database Backup**: Export the database to a `.sql` file.  
8. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Select minors, sort by age, filter by name, update and delete data.

## 📅 Day 2: SQL and Python  

1. **MySQL Connection in Python**: Connect to `LaPlateforme` via `mysql-connector-python`.  
2. **Create New Tables**: `floor` and `room` tables with relationships between them.  
3. **Insert Data**: Insert floors and rooms into the database.  
4. **Display Rooms**: Retrieve and display the names and capacities of the rooms.  
5. **SQL Calculations**: Calculate the total area of floors and the capacity of rooms.  
6. **Advanced Queries**: Select employees earning more than 3000€, retrieve employees with their department.  
7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Create an `Employee` class in Python to manipulate the database.  
8. **Zoo Management**: Create a `zoo` database with `animal` and `cage` tables, and develop a program to add, delete, and display animals and cages.
