# 📂 Runtrack BDD — SQL & Python  

## 📌 Introduction  
This repository compiles exercises completed over 2 days, focusing on learning SQL with MySQL and leveraging Python to interact with databases.  
The goal is to master database creation, querying, and cross-connecting SQL and Python for practical data management tasks.

---

## 📅 Day 1: SQL Fundamentals  

1. **Install MySQL** — Set up the MySQL server and access the SQL terminal.  
2. **Database Creation** — Create a new database named `LaPlateforme`.  
3. **Student Table** — Define a `student` table with essential fields: id, first name, last name, age, email.  
4. **Table Structure** — Examine the schema of the `student` table.  
5. **Data Insertion** — Populate the `student` table with entries.  
6. **Data Retrieval** — Display all students using SELECT queries.  
7. **Backup** — Export the database as a `.sql` backup file.  
8. **Advanced SQL** — Run queries for minors, age-based sorting, name filtering, updating, and deleting data.

📁 SQL scripts and solutions are organized in the **day1/** directory.

## 📅 Day 2: Advanced SQL & Python Integration  

1. **Python MySQL Connection** — Use `mysql-connector-python` to interface with the `LaPlateforme` database.  
2. **Schema Expansion** — Create additional tables: `floor` and `room`, including their relationships.  
3. **Populating Data** — Insert records for floors and rooms.  
4. **Room Display** — Query and print room names and capacity figures.  
5. **SQL Aggregation** — Calculate total floor area and room capacities.  
6. **Complex Queries** — Find employees earning above 3000€ and list employees with department info.  
7. **OOP Data Management** — Implement a Python `Employee` class for structured database manipulation.  
8. **Zoo Management Module** — Set up a `zoo` database with `animal` and `cage` tables; build Python logic to create, delete, and view records.

📁 All SQL and Python files for this part are found in the **day2/** directory.
